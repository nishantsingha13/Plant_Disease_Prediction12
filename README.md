## Mission:
Helping to identify plant diseases efficiently for healthier crops and improved harvests.

## About the Dataset:
  - **Size:** Approximately 87,900 RGB images.
  - **Content:** 87K images of healthy and diseased crop leaves categorized into 38 classes.
  -** Dataset Split:**
      - Training set: 70,295 images.
      - Validation set: 17,572 images.
      - Test set: 33 images for prediction.
        
## How It Works:
  - **Upload Image:** Go to the Disease Recognition page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
  - **Analysis:** Our system processes the image using advanced deep learning algorithms to identify potential diseases.
  - **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.
